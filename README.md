# CS330-NetworkingProject: <i>Diametrical Brawl</i>
## Running the Program
### Server
In order to run the server, use the command ```java -jar Server.jar``` in the ```Server``` folder in a unix command line. Once the command line prints the message <i>"Server is running..."</i>, then you can run clients which connect to it.

### Client
I have included executables for Windows and Linux machines for the client program. Navigate to <i>Client/Board/application.linux</i> or <i>Client/Board/application.windows</i> to locate the executable files for each.

<i>*Note: Make sure to run the server before running the client program. You can ensure the server is running since it will print to the console saying so. If you do not run the server first, the client will still try to contact it and thus it will not work.</i>

You must run at least two instances of the client since the game is multiplayer and thus requires more than one player. Once you have two or more clients running, then you can click the <i>"Start"</i> button in order to start the game.
