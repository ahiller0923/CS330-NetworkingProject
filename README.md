## Running the Program
### Server
In order to run the server, open the <i>Server</i> project folder in an IDE (I use Eclipse) and set the run configuration to run the main class in <i>Server.java</i>

### Client
I have included executables for Windows and Linux machines for the client program. Navigate to <i>Client/Board/application.linux</i> or <i>Client/Board/application.windows</i> to locate the executable files for each.

<i>*Note: Make sure to run the server in the IDE before running the client program. You can ensure the server is running since it will print to the console saying so. If you do not run the server first, the client will still try to contact it and thus it will not work.
